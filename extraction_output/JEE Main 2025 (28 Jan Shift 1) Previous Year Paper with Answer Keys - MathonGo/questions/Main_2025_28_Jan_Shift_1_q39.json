The bead moves under the combined action of gravity and a massless spring ( k ) attached to the bottom of the hoop. The equilibrium length of the spring is '  '. If the bead is released from top of the hoop with (negligible) zero initial speed, velocity of bead, when the length of spring becomes ' R ', would be (spring",
